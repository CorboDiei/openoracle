# OpenOracle

Democratization of dataset labelling and creation.

## What is it?

OpenOracle is a platform as a service where users can engage in dataset creation and labeling for free. Datasets can be either procedurally or bulk labeled. To aid in procedural labeling or active learning, we provide a python package. Labelling is completed by users for Label Credits, which a user can spend have their own dataset labeled. This is to provide an incentive to label the stored unlabeled data. Any datasets uploaded to and labeled by the platform are available for download.
