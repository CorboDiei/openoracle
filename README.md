# remOracle

remOracle is a platform as a service that will begin as a platform for machine learning (specifically active learning) practitioners to label data.

## The Idea

remOracle started when I discovered the underutilized practice of active learning, also known as optimal learning in statistics, where a selected labeler, or oracle, would be procedurally given new data to label that the machine learning algorithm thinks would be most beneficial to have labeled. I thought this seemed like a very promising area, but saw certain challenges associated with it, such as reduced access to dedicated labellers. No online label farm offers time contracted labelers, instead opting for pricing based on volume of labeled data. This is not optimal for active learning, where bias and time to label can be reduced by having dedicated contracted workers.

## The Reality

This is quite a task that will take lots of implementation and a fairly large user base to operate with any regularity. When I had the idea to allow practitioners to test their tasks, I decided to alter the beginning of the project to a practitioner-based service where practitioners can easily view and label their own data procedurally.
